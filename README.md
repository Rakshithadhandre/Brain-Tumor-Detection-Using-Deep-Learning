# BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION USING ADVANCED NEURAL NETWORK
In this project we explore the field of tumor detection in brain using deep learning techniques. Early diagnosis of brain tumors is an essential task in medical work to find out whether the tumor can potentially become cancerous. Deep learning is a handy and efficient method for image classification. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging technique used to diagnosing brain tumor disease. We conducted an analysis of a selected dataset consisting of 2610 MRI images. Our focus was, on evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of algorithms, namely MobileNet, CNN, DenseNet and VGG in detection of brain tumors. The CNN and DenseNet models demonstrated accuracies of 84% and 84.42% while VGG19 performed lower at 83.27% highlighting the varying performance of models when it comes to identification of tumor. Notably, MobileNet emerged as the leading performer, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of 85.31%. Developed a user-friendly interface where users can simply upload an image. The predicted tumor from the image will be displayed as the label whether the tumor is present or not. The main aim of this paper is to distinguish between normal and abnormal pixels, based on texture based and statistical based features. The techniques of deep learning are being effectively employed for brain tumor detection and prevention at an early stage.
